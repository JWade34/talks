F# is a functional programming language that runs within the .NET framework. In
this talk, we'll learn what it means to be a functional language and how F# ties
this together with the rest of the .NET framework. Everything will be
live-coded, so you'll get to see exactly how things work as they're coded out.
This talk is very beginner friendly to both functional and .NET development
alike - so come join us!
