What is F#?

Functional

.NET Framework

Kind of like Haskell, Erlang,
Scala, Clojure, etc.

But kind of like C# and VB.NET

Quiz

.NET Framework

It's more of an ecosytem than a framework

Follows the CLI
(Common Language Infrastructure)

Gets compiled down into CIL
(Common Intermediate Language)

Runs on the CLR
(Common Language Runtime)

You can integrate C#, F#, VB.NET, etc.

F# natively supports .NET classes,
interfaces, and structures

Functional Programming

Some Core Concepts

1) Pure Functions
(No side effects)

Side Effects:

Modifying state

Accessesing Variables outside of scope

Reading/Writing to disk

Printing to console

2) Referential Transparency

foo() => 8

This means you can't use things like random numbers

3) Immutable Variables

Why would anyone use FP?

Concurrency

Testability

It's just plain simple

Most FP languages won't be true FP

F#

Demo

Statically Typed

let x = 10

Is it strongly or weakly typed?

F# is strongly typed

It does use Type Inference though

Higher Order Functions

3 key higher order functions
you'll use in any language

Map
Filter
Fold

Map

Filter

Fold

Concurrency

Concurrency vs Parellelism

More common to use
async in F#
