Compiled vs Interpreted

Memory Management

Stack vs Heap

Garbage Collection

Reference Counting
Mark-Sweep
Mark-Compact
Copying
Generational

Type Systems

Static vs Dynamic

Reflection / Type Introspection

Strong vs Weak

x = 1
y = "2"
x + y = ?

Common Mistake

int x = 5;

Type Safety

Static/Dynamic deals with *when*
Strong/Weak deals with *how*

Concurrency

Global Interpreter Lock
